## Game Universe

The player will have to take part in the process of forming solar systems. He will fight for survival by controlling a small little planet, which is gradually gaining mass by collecting particles of matter and other small celestial bodies.
The speed in the game is measured not in minutes, but in hundreds of thousands of years. Thus, one match lasts about 100 thousand years.
Time in the game universe runs its course. Inevitably there appears technologically advanced civilizations. Over time, the game will change Epoches. The initial set of planets represents the First Epoch of "natural planets". The Second Epoch of "wandering planets" will contain worlds modified by a technically advanced civilization. On them, you will find Space elevators, planetary engines, Bussard ramjets, etc. The Third Epoch of "artificial planets" will consist of fully artificial cosmic bodies, such as Dyson spheres and Ringworlds. 

## Gameplay

Fight with players from all over the world as you try to become the largest Planet in a solar system! Control your tiny planet and eat other players to grow larger. Mint your own, unique generative planet as NFT to enter the battlefield!
